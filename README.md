# Pug-Game
This was the last project I made for my Unity Development class before the final pyramid project. This one was more open-ended than the
ones that came before so I knew that I wanted to do something that was silly but also used some things I hadn't previously attempted in
Unity. The idea is that you are leading a pug back to their house but they face different kinds of struggles on the way there. At night,
animals are out and dangerous in certain areas and, in the day, there are trappers or other people that just like keeping pugs for
themselves. The main difficult was making some way for the pug to actually follow the path that the user draws on the screen. I basically
did it by making the path discrete using little cubes to visualize it. The cubes are put into an array and the pug moves towards the first
one and then when getting close enough his velocity changes so as to move him towards the next one. It is a rather simple game but I
hadn't seen a lot of games that make you do this kind of prediction and then makes you sit and watch as your plans unfold without being
able to do anything once your path is already laid out.
